This is the Wi-Fi / Wi-Fi Direct based peer to peer communication framework for Android. It stands for "Croconaut Public Transport", Croconaut was a "startup" from the times when we thought we can finish the product in three months. :) It's still to be decided whether it's going to be open source or not, it's two years' of hard work and pretty impressive feature list.
